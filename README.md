# titanic
From Kaggle titanic competition- beating the benchmark and trying to better by blended model.
We fit two models a random forest and beat the benchmark by imputing missing data and then blended a RF and a gbm and t using part of the training data. However the end result was not able to beat benchmark the original random forest model.
